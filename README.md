Hellooooooooo
This is my simple text based pokemon game based in generation 1. Using the random python module to simulate 50/50 battle odds. I am using the pokemon yellow version script.
I know the code is spagetti but this is a basic version. 


This is the original version, Gabbonbon is the creator. If you would like to use this program in commercial products please contact me.

One year no progress... I will finish! (trust)
